star exodus notes

- Rework travel
	- Rework FTL - DONE
		- remove star map
		- progression is more linear, procedurally generated as you go.
		- Travel between stars is "instant", but requires spin-up and cooldown
			- spin-up: constant time
			- cooldown: proportional to distance travelled, inverse to fleet speed
		- Fuel only consumed when FTL happens, consumed all at once
		- Fuel consumed is proportional to distance travelled, larger ships have worse efficiency (based on mass stat)
		- Each ship has independent fuel consumption
		- Mining & exploring can continue during spin-up (but stops upon jump)
		- Can abort jump during warmup
	- Events
		- Chance of event upon entering system or discovering planet feature
		- Threat: % Chance of being attacked in system per day
			- Threat starts low upon arrival
			- Every day spent in system increases threat (rate varies per system)
			- Threat over 100% causes stronger enemies to appear
			- Threat stays low in colonized systems (safe havens)
		- Need to stub in combat for now
		- Combat events have "difficulty rating" depending on various factors (Threat, dark sector, fleet strength, etc.)
	- Main sequence
		- from a star, a list of 2-5 destinations with varying distances (fuel cost)
		- Cannot go backwards
		- theoretically infinite
		- event difficulty is based on your current strength
		- occasional safe haven systems
	- Missions
		- Unlocked upon reaching certain points in the main sequence or given by planets in colonized systems
		- story driven, scripted sequences of systems & events
		- required to "win" the game (retake homework)
	- Dark sectors
		- more dangerous sequences with loot & resources at the end
		- procedurally generated each time
		- various levels of difficulty, finish a level to unlock the next
		- difficulty levels can be repeated (generates a new random sector)
		- can bail from a dark sector run at any time (won't get rewards)

- Rework resource gathering
	- exploration yields "caches" of various size based on planet type
	- resource gathering over time happens automatically (don't need to manually assign ships)
- QoL changes
	- Allow setting exploration & mining from planet details screen
	- Move day counter and Next Day button to outside tabs (visible from all screens)
	- Overview screens (cargo of all ships, net resource consumption & gathering, exploration)
	- Disallow exploring already explored planets
	- Alerts on ship detail panel for low fuel, food, etc.
	- Available cargo space of selected ship on trade panel
- Add ship building
	- Start with construction ship that can build small ships when stationary
	- Can get mobile shipyard later to build bigger ships
	- biggest ships must be built in pieces
- Tech tree
	- Able to research/acquire techs
	- Techs allow building new ships, weapons, modules, improving existing ships, etc.
- Combat
	- Divide fleet into "Battlegroups"
	- Number of battle groups is capped (research can increase)
	- Battle groups act as "units" receiving orders as one
	- Turn based actions
		- Order determined by "initiative" (speed of slowest ship in group)
		- Action consists of selecting a "Tactic" and a "Target"
		- Tactics determine what the group does, target is who the group does it to
		- Target can be friendly or enemy depending on tactic
		- Example tactics: 
			- Bombard (long range attack)
			- Screen (intercept enemy tactics)
			- Retreat (move back a zone with an evade bonus)
			- Intercept (Interfere/disable enemy tactics)
			- Blockade (prevent enemy movement)
		- Special equipment & weapons can provide unique tactics
		- Select actions for all ships, when all are ready, all actions are executed at once, ordering determined by ship speed
	- Range: 5 "zones" where ships can be
		- Each side has long and mid range zones, and share a close range zone
		- Moving between zones is an affect of a tactic
		- Moving out of a zone occupied by enemies evokes a penalty (similar to attack of opportunity)
	- Weapons
		- Determines what happens when an offensive tactic is used
		- Attributes:
			- Damage: Damage per shot
			- Salvo: How many shots in an attack
			- Tracking: How easily weapon can hit fast targets
			- Accuracy: Hit chance at various ranges
		- Hit chance based on tracking vs enemy evasion. accuracy vs enemy range
	- Defenses
		- Hull points: When this reaches 0, ship is destroyed. Must be repaired after combat
		- Armor: Damage reduction to hull points. Can be reduced/removed
		- Shields: Bonus "health." Does not benefit from armor. Regenerates automatically after combat
		- Point defense: Can destroy missiles & damage fighters attacking the ship
		- Evasion: Based on speed, lowers enemy accuracy
- Endgame/Postgame
	- Upon winning, two options
		1. Timewarp back to before homeworld mission, can keep going forever
		2. NG+: Keep your XP (maybe some ships?), start over with new fleet, everything is scaled higher
